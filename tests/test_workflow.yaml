  #This defines a step in the workflow. Each step represents an action on a single module
  #This is a human legible name for the step
  - name: Sciclops gets plate from stacks
  #This defines which module the action will run on, in this case, a Huson Sciclops PlateCrane robot that has stacks to store wellplates
    module: sciclops
  #This tells the module which action in its library to run, in this case grabbing a wellplate from one of the storage tower
    command: get_plate
  #These arguments specify the parameters for the action above, in this case, which tower the arm will pull a plate from.

  #This represents checks that will take place before the system runs, in this case, there are none specified
