=====================
Creating Your First Workflow
=====================

Creating your first workflow is a simple process. 

#. Ensure your `workcell.yaml` file contains all necessary information about the experimental instruments.
#. Create a new YAML file for your workflow.

#. Follow these steps to create your workflow:

   .. code-block:: python

      # Code to create a workflow goes here

#. Save your workflow and run it. During execution, each workflow step is read from the workflow file and translated into the network by their corresponding executor.

For detailed examples of workflow and protocol definitions, please refer to the Background document.

Congratulations! You have created your first workflow.
